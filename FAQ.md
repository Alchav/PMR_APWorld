### What do N1W3 and S2E1 mean in Dry Dry Desert?

The prefixes for the desert areas indicate what direction they are from the center (which is the screen with the stone cactus.) N means north, or up, while S means south, or downwards. E means east, or right, while w means west, or left. Be careful with east and west if you have mirror mode turned on.

### How am I supposed to know what I'm buying from the shop?

Items sold in shops or found in Merlow's item rewards will be automatically hinted if they are progression items. If they are unhinted, they are not progression items. Items are not able to have names and descriptions in the current version of the base mod, so this is the best workaround to make sure you don't waste any hard earned coins on filler items. Note that the items sold by Merlow are never going to be progression, as you require every star piece in the game to buy all of them.

### Why is the item I was sent not in my inventory yet?

Currently, items are granted while you are in the overworld on a one second loop by the game, and the items are written into the game on a one second loop by the Bizhawk Client for Archipelago. They will not continue to flow into your inventory while in battle, paused, transitioning between screens, in dialogue, and so on. This means when several items are queued to be received, it may still take some time for the item to show up. If it seems clear that no more items are showing up and you are still missing one or more items, please reach out to us in the Paper Mario thread in the Archipelago discord.
