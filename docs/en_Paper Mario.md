# Paper Mario

## Where is the settings page?

The [player settings page for this game](../player-settings) contains all the options you need to configure and export a
config file.

## What does randomization do to this game?

Items which the player would normally acquire throughout the game have been moved around. Logic remains, so the game is 
always able to be completed, but because of the item shuffle the player may need to access certain areas before they 
would in the vanilla game. 

## What items and locations get shuffled?

Shuffled items can include those received from NPCs or found in chests, blocks, trees, bushes, or free-standing in the overworld. 
Optionally, you can shuffle partners, gear, star pieces from hidden panels, letter rewards, partner upgrades, and more.

## Which items can be in another player's world?

Any of the items which can be shuffled may also be placed into another player's world. 

## What does another world's item look like in Paper Mario?

Items belonging to other worlds are represented by the Present item. (Not actually sure yet)

## When the player receives an item, what happens?

When the player receives an item, Mario will hold the item above his head, just as he does when acquiring an item
normally. (Not actually sure yet)
